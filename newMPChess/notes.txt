User: Hey Claude I want you to write code for a multiplayer game of chess, that will have a client and a server implementation. The client will be used by two players who are connected to the central server. The game is server-authoritative and all player moves are validated & approved by the server only. The game clients will have a synchronous connection open with the server. Build a nice, pretty and smart ASCII interface to show the chess board, all the pieces, and the moves on the client apps. You may build multiple classes, and functions/methods as necessary, write a new library if required, and everything is written using standard C++ 17 only, do not use Boost for this. Ensure all the resource names are human-readable, easy, and all code has good error handling at every stage.
Model: I'll help you create a multiplayer chess game with client-server architecture. Let's break this down into multiple parts. I'll start with the core components and then show how they interact.

First, here's the common header file containing shared definitions:

Hey Claude I want you to write code for a multiplayer game of chess, that will have a client and a server implementation. The client will be used by two players who are connected to the central server. The game is server-authoritative and all player moves are validated & approved by the server only. The game clients will have a synchronous connection open with the server. Please include the actual game logic in the ChessGame class, with full validations, check/checkmate detection, client-server message handling, and include the network communication protocols. Build a nice, pretty and smart ASCII interface to show the chess board, all the pieces, and the moves on the client apps. You may build multiple classes, and functions/methods as necessary, write a new library if required, and everything is written using standard C++ 17 only, do not use Boost for this. Ensure all the resource names are human-readable, easy, and all code has good error handling at every stage. Make sure you write all the individual files for me, and end with the build instructions for the project. Write the FULL code, do not write incomplete code. Including the logic for "En Passant captures for pawns", "Castling for Kings", and "Pawn Promotion".


1. On the server, add a command line argument to support displaying all communication between the clients and the server - full verbose
2. On both the server & the client, enable support for full detailed logging, and with different logging levels, that gets written to a server-side, and both client-side log files with every entry showing a time-stamp, and details of what function is doing/running what, and such.
3. On the client side, start the app by asking for a player handle - and use that to show the appropriate details of who is doing what on the chess board.

23 May 2025:

You are an expert in C++ programming, Qt, and cmake. This project uses C++ 17, and Qt 6.5.3. Do not rush to respond, take time to review everything as listed, and ensure your response is contextually-aware and contextually-accurate.

** FIRST PROMPT:
Hey Claude I want you to write portable C++17 server side code for a multiplayer game of chess, that will support up to 2 game clients connecting to it remotely.
- The game should be server-authoritative and all player moves are validated & approved by the server only. The game should start as soon as two players are successfully connected to the game server, and the server will randomly decide the pawn colour for each player, send the info back to the players to start the game
- The game server should be capable of handling full checks & validations, check/checkmate/stalemate detection, client-server message handling with a optimised & efficient custom protocol, including the logic for "En Passant captures for pawns", "Castling for Kings", and "Pawn Promotion" 
- Every time a player makes a move, the server receives the move, validates it, and only then messages back to the clients to update their UI
- The game server should also maintain a timer for each player, that is configurable for rapid chess, professional chess, and casual chess (that will support up to 7 days time limit for a move to be made by a player)
- The game server should performs complex computations to recommend and send different possible moves for each player that the client will also present only to that player, before they make their move
- The game server should also include the ability to play as a bot who can play efficiently with a human player connected to the server via the game client 
- Build a nice, pretty and smart ASCII interface to show the chess board, all the pieces, and the moves made by the players at any point-in-time with the standard chess notations of each move displayed under it; all this will also be logged in the troubleshooting log file
- The game servers should also include a full game state serialiser and deserialiser so games can be saved and restored accurately with every move data, and corresponding time taken by the player for each move
- Include detailed game server logging so we can have a complete view of every action that happened on the server, every message received from the clients, every instruction given to the clients, and all such
- Preferably write everything in a single .H with its corresponding .CPP files called MPChessServer.h and MPChessServer.cpp. Inside that, build multiple classes, and functions/methods as necessary, write a new library if required, and write everything using standard C++ 17 only, do not use Boost for this. Ensure all the resource names are human-readable, easy to understand, code is well-commented, and all code has good error handling at every stage.
- Write the FULL code, do not write incomplete code.

Description of the Implementation
This chess server implementation provides a full-featured, server-authoritative multiplayer chess game with the following key components:

# Chess Logic
* Complete chess rules implementation including all special moves (en passant, castling, promotion)
* Check, checkmate and stalemate detection
* Draw detection (50-move rule, threefold repetition, insufficient material)
* Move validation and generation
* Basic AI opponent using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning

# Networking
* Cross-platform socket implementation
* Custom protocol for client-server communication
* Support for multiple simultaneous games
* Connection handling and error recovery

# Game Features
* Time control with multiple preset configurations
* Game state serialization for saving/loading games
* ASCII board representation
* Move history recording with standard chess notation
* Support for resign, draw offers

# Server Infrastructure
* Multi-threaded architecture for handling connections and game processing
* Game matching and player management
* Logging system

Usage
To run the server:

./chess_server [port]
Where [port] is optional and defaults to 8080.

The server accepts client connections and handles various command messages. Clients can connect to the server, join or create games, make moves, and more. The server validates all moves, maintains game state, and ensures fair play.

# Extending the System
This implementation could be extended with:
* User authentication and persistent accounts
* Game ratings and matchmaking
* Tournament organization
* Advanced move analysis features
* A more sophisticated AI opponent
* Spectator functionality
* Game replay and analysis tools


NEXT PROMPT:
Please update the code to add user-authentication, and support persistent player accounts,
with games saved with player details. Player account details and rating and other metadata
should be written to a flat file on disk. Support a good efficient player rating system, and
offer matchmaking. If another competing player is unavailable for up to say 60 seconds after
initiating matchmaking, the player should be matched with the in-built server bot, and play
should start notifying the player about being matched to a bot. Please enhance the AI bot
opponent for better ratings based gameplay. Build game reply and analysis functions. Rewrite
the full functions, classes to be modified, so that they can be copy-pasted to be replaced in
the previous source code files.
