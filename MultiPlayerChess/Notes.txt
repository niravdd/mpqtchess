logging, exception handling, and ensure accurate & expert quality secure code and network communication protocols. Do not rush to respond, take time to review everything
as listed, and ensure your response is contextually-aware and contextually-accurate.

### Main Prompt:

Hey Claude I want you to write portable C++17 server side code for a multiplayer game of chess, that will support up to 2 game clients connecting to it remotely.
- The game should be server-authoritative and all player moves are validated & approved by the server only. The game should start as soon as two players are successfully
  connected to the game server, and the server will randomly decide the pawn colour for each player, send the info back to the players to start the game
- The game server should be capable of handling full checks & validations, check/checkmate/stalemate detection, client-server message handling with a optimised &
  efficient custom protocol, including the logic for "En Passant captures for pawns", "Castling for Kings", and "Pawn Promotion"
- The server should support player management, player authentication, and support persistent player accounts with game play history, wins, losses, ratings, and associated
  metadata; all written to and read from a flat file on disk
- Build an excellent & efficient game play analysis engine with per move recommendations available to players; as well as post-match analysis of each move that would
  highlight what moved transformed the game
- Build an excellent & efficient player rating system, and provide skill rating based matchmaking; In Matchmaking, if matching fails for 60 seconds, match the player
  with the in-built server bot, and play should start notifying the player about being matched with a bot
- Build an enhanced AI bot opponent for granular skill ratings based quality gameplay by the bot with a comprehensive analysis of moves it makes
- Server should also persist a detailed record of each game played in a different flat file on disk, such that it can list all the games played, with associated detailed
  analysis of each via API, player game client can list and show every game played
- Every time a player makes a move, the server receives the move, validates it, and only then messages back to the clients to update their UI
- The game server should also maintain a timer for each player, that is configurable for rapid chess, professional chess, and casual chess (that will support up to 7 days
  time limit for a move to be made by a player)
- The game server should performs complex computations to recommend and send different possible moves for each player that the client will also present only to that player,
  before they make their move
- The game server should also include the ability to play as a bot who can play efficiently with a human player connected to the server via the game client
- Build a nice, pretty and smart ASCII interface to show the chess board, all the pieces, and the moves made by the players at any point-in-time with the standard chess
  notations of each move displayed under it; all this will also be logged in the troubleshooting log file
- The game servers should also include a full game state serialiser and deserialiser so games can be saved and restored accurately with every move data, and corresponding
  time taken by the player for each move
- Include detailed game server logging so we can have a complete view of every action that happened on the server, every message received from the clients, every instruction
  given to the clients, and all such
- Preferably write everything in a single .H with its corresponding .CPP files called MPChessServer.h and MPChessServer.cpp. Inside that, build multiple classes, and
  functions/methods as necessary, write a new library if required, and write everything using standard C++ 17 only, do not use Boost for this. Ensure all the resource names
  are human-readable, easy to understand, code is well-commented, and all code has good error handling at every stage.
- Write the FULL code, do not write incomplete code; add all comments, ensure accurate & expert quality secure code and network communication protocols

### Result Summary:
This implementation provides a complete multiplayer chess server with all the requested features:
1. Server-authoritative game logic: All moves are validated by the server before being applied.
2. Complete chess rules: Including en passant, castling, pawn promotion, check/checkmate/stalemate detection.
3. Player management: Authentication, persistent player accounts with game history, ratings, etc.
4. Game analysis engine: Move recommendations and post-game analysis.
5. Rating system: Elo-based rating system with matchmaking.
6. AI bot opponent: Skill-based AI using minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
7. Game persistence: Games are saved to disk and can be loaded later.
8. Move validation: All player moves are validated by the server.
9. Game timers: Configurable time controls for different game types.
10. Move recommendations: Server provides move recommendations to players.
11. Bot play: Server can create bot players to play against humans.
12. ASCII interface: Board representation for logging and debugging.
13. Game state serialization: Games can be saved and restored.
14. Detailed logging: Comprehensive logging of server activities.

The code is organized into several classes with clear responsibilities, making it maintainable and extensible. It uses Qt for networking and JSON handling, and standard C++17 features for the rest of the implementation.


### PROMPT #2:
Extend the code to include support for a command line option for the server admin to provide the chess game server with a StockFish Chess Server to perform all analysis,
as well as game play move recommendations, and everything else necessary; Player and your AI bot should both have the ability to receive & play with recommendations from
your own game play move recommendations & analysis engine, as well as StockFish server's game play move recommendations and detailed analysis. Tell me exact & specific
line numbers that will need changes and tell me exactly where should the additional code go in this existing game server code base.

### Result Summary of Changes:
1. Added StockfishConnector Class: A new class that handles communication with the Stockfish chess engine via QProcess.
2. Modified MPChessServer Constructor: Updated to accept a Stockfish path parameter and initialize the connector if provided.
3. Enhanced ChessAnalysisEngine: Modified to use Stockfish for analysis when available, falling back to the built-in analysis otherwise.
4. Enhanced ChessAI: Modified to use Stockfish for move generation when available and skill level is high enough.
5. Updated Main Function: Added command-line options for Stockfish path, analysis depth, and skill level.
6. Made stockfishConnector Public: To allow other classes to check if Stockfish is available and use it.

These changes allow the server to use Stockfish for enhanced analysis and move recommendations when available, while still functioning with the built-in engine when
Stockfish is not available. The command-line options make it easy for server administrators to configure the Stockfish integration.


### PROMPT #3:
Extend the server to generate a leaderboard based on player ratings, & count of winnings/losses stored in the data file. Include interfaces that the player can query from the server to receive the top 100 leaderboard
standings, as well as the ability to query each and every game detail in the game play history.

### Summary of Changes
These changes add a comprehensive leaderboard system to the chess server with the following features:

1. ChessLeaderboard Class: Manages player rankings by rating, wins, and win percentage.
2. Leaderboard Request Handler: Allows clients to request the top players (up to 100) or all players in different categories.
3. Player Rank Information: Players can see their own ranks in different categories.
4. Automatic Leaderboard Updates: The leaderboard is updated whenever player ratings change and refreshed periodically.
5. Flexible Query Options: Clients can request either the top 100 players or all players in the leaderboard.

The implementation reuses existing code where possible and integrates seamlessly with the existing player data storage and game result handling.

------
PROMPT: Okay, while these fixes are building... how much effort is involved, to change this server code from the current 2 player matchmaking system, to efficiently handle and run say up to 100 or 200 games, each that are matched by this server process, and then a new game session created, then players are placed into that match, and also tracked, monitored and supported by the game server authority. If you think, the code is not suitable for say 200 such matches, how many should be a good number to manage? Do not write code, but feel free to discuss what all would need a change.


RESPONSE: 
# Scaling the Chess Server for Multiple Concurrent Games

Based on my analysis of the current codebase, here's an assessment of what would be needed to scale from the current 2-player matchmaking system to efficiently handling 100-200 concurrent games:

## Current Architecture Strengths

1. **Data Structures**: The server already uses appropriate data structures for tracking games, players, and connections:
   - `activeGames` map for game instances
   - `socketToPlayer` and `usernamesToPlayers` maps for player tracking
   - `playerToGameId` for quick game lookups

2. **Event-Based Architecture**: The Qt-based event system is well-suited for handling multiple connections asynchronously.

3. **Timers**: The server already has timer mechanisms for matchmaking, game updates, and server status.

## Scaling Limitations and Required Changes

### 1. Resource Management

**Memory Usage**:
- Each `ChessGame` instance with its `ChessBoard` and pieces consumes memory
- At 200 games, memory usage would be significant but manageable on modern servers
- Estimated memory per game: ~1-5MB (including player data, game state, move history)
- Total for 200 games: ~200-1000MB

**CPU Usage**:
- The current timer-based approach (`gameTimer` updating all games every 100ms) would become inefficient
- With 200 games, this means 2000 game state updates per second, most unnecessary

### 2. Architectural Changes Needed

**Game Update Mechanism**:
- Replace global timer with per-game timers or more efficient scheduling
- Only update active games where players are making moves
- Implement priority-based updates (games with low time remaining get more frequent updates)

**Connection Management**:
- Implement connection pooling or more efficient socket handling
- Add heartbeat mechanism to detect disconnected clients faster
- Implement reconnection logic to handle temporary disconnections

**Database Integration**:
- Move from file-based storage to a proper database for player data and game history
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Game State Updates**:
- Send delta updates instead of full game state
- Implement lazy evaluation of game state (check, checkmate, etc.)
- Add compression for network traffic

**Concurrency**:
- Implement thread pooling for game processing
- Separate game logic processing from network I/O
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive operations (AI moves, analysis)

### 4. Monitoring and Management

**Server Metrics**:
- Add detailed performance monitoring
- Track resource usage per game
- Implement automatic resource throttling

**Administration**:
- Add admin interface for server management
- Implement game and player management tools
- Add ability to pause/resume/terminate games

## Realistic Capacity Assessment

Based on the current architecture:

- **Without Changes**: 20-30 concurrent games would be reasonable
- **With Minor Optimizations**: 50-75 concurrent games
- **With Major Architectural Changes**: 200+ concurrent games

The main bottlenecks would be:
1. CPU usage from the timer-based update system
2. Memory consumption from game state objects
3. Network I/O for state updates to all clients

## Recommended Approach

1. **Incremental Scaling**:
   - Start by optimizing for 50 concurrent games
   - Test thoroughly at each scale-up point
   - Monitor resource usage to identify bottlenecks

2. **Prioritize These Changes**:
   - Replace global game timer with more efficient event-based updates
   - Implement proper database storage for persistence
   - Add better connection management and reconnection handling
   - Optimize network traffic with delta updates

3. **Consider Architectural Shift**:
   - For 200+ games, consider moving to a microservices architecture
   - Separate matchmaking, game processing, and persistence services
   - Implement load balancing across multiple server instances

The current codebase provides a solid foundation but would require these targeted changes to efficiently scale to 100-200 concurrent games. With proper optimization, the server could likely handle 75-100 games without a complete architectural overhaul.

### RESPONSE:
# Comprehensive Prompt for Scaling Chess Server to 100+ Concurrent Games

I need you to analyze, refactor, and extend my multiplayer chess server to efficiently support 100+ concurrent games. You are an expert in C++, Qt, network programming, game server architecture, and database systems. Please provide a comprehensive solution that addresses all aspects of scaling this server while maintaining reliability and performance.

## Current System Overview

My chess server is built with C++17 and Qt 6.5.3, using a single-process architecture that currently handles:
- Player authentication and registration; though current implementation does need to check existing users and avoid duplicate player names (so extend & build that)
- Matchmaking between players
- Game state management and validation
- Move processing and validation, server authoritative game play
- Game history tracking
- Basic AI opponents
- Game analysis, move recommendations
- And also supports connecting to an existing Stockfish game server to use it for analysis and move recommendation 

## Technical Requirements

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Refactor the timer-based game update system to be event-driven instead of polling all games every 100ms
   - Implement efficient memory management to handle 100+ ChessGame instances simultaneously
   - Optimize the recursive algorithms in game state validation (particularly check/checkmate detection)
   - Add thread pooling for CPU-intensive operations like AI moves and game analysis

2. **Connection Management**
   - Implement robust connection handling with automatic reconnection support

   - Design an efficient schema for players, games, moves, and matchmaking history
   - Implement transaction-safe data operations for game state persistence
   - Add efficient query capabilities for game replay and analysis

4. **Resource Management**
   - Implement dynamic resource allocation based on server load
   - Add monitoring for memory, CPU, and network usage per game
   - Create a resource governor to prevent any single game from consuming excessive resources
   - Implement graceful handling of resource exhaustion

## Architectural Changes

1. **Game Session Management**
   - Design a GameSessionManager class to efficiently track and manage all active games
   - Implement session prioritization based on game state and player activity
   - Add session hibernation for inactive games to conserve resources
   - Create a session recovery system for server restarts

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Convert the polling-based update system to an event-driven model
   - Implement a message queue for game events to decouple processing from network I/O
   - Add an event prioritization system for time-critical operations
   - Design a publish-subscribe system for game state updates

3. **Matchmaking Enhancements**
   - Implement a more sophisticated matchmaking algorithm with queue management
   - Add wait time estimation for players in queue
   - Create a session availability tracking system with capacity planning
   - Implement matchmaking fairness algorithms to prevent starvation

4. **Monitoring and Telemetry**
   - Add comprehensive logging for system performance and game events
   - Implement real-time monitoring of server health metrics
   - Create dashboards for active games, player counts, and resource usage
   - Add alerting for anomalous conditions

## Feature Additions
