(Context): I'm writing this high-quality multiplayer game of chess in C++ 17 and Qt 6.5.3 that is also intended to be highly portable across many OS/CPU platforms. The project directory is "/Users/niravdd/Downloads/work/MultiPlayerChess/" and the client code is in the "/client", while the server code is in the "/server". The game is server-authoritative, and is built to support almost all the game's features. Together with that capability, the game also supports AI bot players, game persistance, game analysis, connecting to a Stockfish server for analytics, next move, leaderboards and many such features. I've intentionally bundled all the server & client codes in a single pair of source files (.cpp & .h), its easier to maintain, so let's continue that unless absolutely necessary. Everything uses a proper coding style, structure, logging, commenting, etc. and you will follow the same when you make any changes.
